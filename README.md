# VEXSizingTool
This is the sizing tool made for the 2025-26 VEX Push Back Game by myself that could be utilized beyond just Push Back

This was initially cut out of wood with a laser kerf of about 0.020"-0.025" on a 36" wide sheet.
All of the logos can be removed, you will want to ungroup the files in adobe illustrator first to do so.
I have had issues cutting and vectoring the entire sheet, thus they are in two separate files.

The VEXU tools may not be ready by the time you see the link, adding or subtracting length to the corresponding vertical and horizontal pairs of pieces will get the desired sizes.
This is also applicable to future years and sizes, from 12" to theoretically as large as any limit becomes.
